## Todo App

This is a React based Todo App which allows you to do three basic things:

### Features
- **Add a todo task:** Write down your todos so that you never forget again! And, yeah, you can add a date as well.
- **Modify it:** You can edit your todos later if you want to update the date or the task itself.
- **Delete it:** Delete it when the task is completed.
- **Bonus:** If you have completed the task and want to keep it in the last, just tap on it to mark it as complete. Then, at the end of the day, you can count the total tasks!
